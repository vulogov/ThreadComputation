# Two-dimentional stack as a data storage.

![TwoStack](twostack.png)

You might hear about stack in low-level languages and stack-based languages like FORT. But that concept of the stack is pretty much linear. Stack is FIFO, or First-In-First-Out linked list, where each element of the stack is a data item. This concept of stack didn't changed much since likely 60-th. And what's wrong with this time-tested concept ? Poor data isolation is one of the common issues with traditional stack. There is literally thousands and thousands examples of what went wrong when function incorrectly reaches for the data in the stack, creating stability, correctness and oftentimes security issues. The stack concept in BUND is different. Each element of the stack is a stack. So, every time, when you work with data stored in the stack, you are working not with globally accessible list of element, but with one of the many, separated data structures. And BUND offers you all basic primitives to control that two-dimensioned world. You can rotate data stack or global stack, you can duplicate and drop data, you can create new stacks and drop existing ones and you can name and position data stacks.
